Step 1: Use MATLAB_Pointwise/airfoilPointwise.m script to generate a single 
		2D structured mesh with O-grid topology in Pointwise. 
		
		Pointwise is automatically opened, the mesh is generated, then Pointwise
		is automatically closed with the file saved. 
		
		The volume conditions are also automatically translated from Pointwise 
		to OpenFOAM format and exported to the constant/polyMesh sub-directory of
		each OpenFOAM case for the grid. 
		
		Given the O-grid topology, no remeshing is required when changing the 
		angle-of-attack (AoA). Instead, the direction of the inlet velocity vector 
		orthogonal to the far-field boundary is adjusted. 
		
		Reference OpenFOAM cases that consider different AoAs are copied from the 
		OF_ref directory, then pasted in a directory named after the parameterised 
		airfoil which is then placed in the UPLOADS directory ready for simulation. 
		

Step 2: Upload the UPLOADS directory, containing all the airfoil sub-directories,
		to the HPC with the given PBS job script (remember to change the email address
		in the job script). 
		
		Otherwise, run the simulations on your local machine if they're not too
		computationally expensive. For this you will need to install Ubuntu. 


Step 3: If uploaded to the HPC and once complete (you will receive an email whenever
		a job has finished or been terminated prematurely), download the raw data to the 
		OF_DATA directory.


Step 4: Use the processOFdata.m script to process the raw data from each log.simpleFoam
		file in OF_DATA and export results to the OF_RESULTS directory. 

		This generates and saves the residual and aerodynamic coefficient convergence 
		plots of each simulated OpenFOAM case. 
		
		This also creates an Excel spreadsheet with the final Cl, Cd, Cm and max. yPlus 
		(in this column order) for each OpenFOAM case.
